### Hi there!
My name is Dia Ganesh Kumar and I am a sophomore at UC Irvine majoring in Business Information Management (combined CS and Business). I am interested in both the business and technology aspects of a company and have been a part of school organizations such as WICS (Women in Computer Science) and Product that help me explore these areas. Apart from being an active member of these clubs, I am currently learning SQL and web development through Udemy and Great Learning. 

Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dia-ganesh-kumar/) and my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1THzU1JtmsvotHHQ6XBhoU40bRX3oBhQen-0oW0rKMZ0/edit?usp=sharing)!.
